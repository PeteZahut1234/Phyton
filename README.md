## Learning Phyton
Documenting my journey learning Phyton.
In [Symtax](#syntax) you'll find useful information that you will need in your quests.
[Hello World](#hello-world) : the classic Hello World program to get started at coding.
 
## Hello world
The syntax to create your first program is the following
```python

print("Hello World")

```

## Syntax
We can use numbers with decimal point or natural numbers
`name` `=` `value` 
```python
age = 20
print(age)
```

If you wanna use multiple words as a name for a variable, you should separate them with an underscore
```python
first_name = "Rolando"
```

For a Boolean value:
```python
is_online = False
```
